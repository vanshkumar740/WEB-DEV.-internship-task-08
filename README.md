# Simple Blog Layout Using Bootstrap 5

## Task Description
This project is a submission for Task 8 of the Elevate Web Development Internship. The objective was to create a responsive blog layout using Bootstrap 5, including a navbar, blog post cards, and a footer with social icons.

## Features
- **Navbar**: A responsive navigation bar with a brand name ("My Blog") and links (Home, About, Blog, Contact) using Bootstrap's `navbar` component.
- **Blog Posts**: A grid of three cards, each with an image, title, description, and "Read More" button, arranged using Bootstrap's grid system (`row-cols-1 row-cols-md-2 row-cols-lg-3`).
- **Footer**: A dark-themed footer with social media icons (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram) from Bootstrap Icons and a copyright notice.
- **Responsiveness**: The layout is responsive across screen sizes, with cards stacking vertically on small screens and forming a grid on larger screens.
- **Bootstrap 5**: Uses Bootstrap 5 CSS and JS CDNs for styling and functionality, along with Bootstrap Icons for social media icons.

## Files
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the blog layout.
- `style.css`: (Optional) Empty file for custom CSS styles.
- `script.js`: (Optional) Empty file for custom JavaScript.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Test responsiveness by resizing the browser or using developer tools to simulate different screen sizes.

## Tools Used
- **VS Code**: For writing and editing the code.
- **Bootstrap 5 CDN**: For styling and components.
- **Browser**: For testing the layout and responsiveness.

## Notes
- Placeholder images are used from `https://via.placeholder.com/400x200`.
- No custom CSS or JS is required as Bootstrap handles all styling and functionality.
- The layout was tested on Chrome and Firefox for responsiveness.
